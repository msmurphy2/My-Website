# My-Website
This website will contain my programming projects from UW Madison as well as personal programming projects to come.

The license inside the Helicopter folder is for the UW Graphics course. We were given the base project, then added our own objects and texture mapping to these objects.

The license inside the main folder is my license for the website.
