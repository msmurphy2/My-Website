		<p>All of the programs on this website were personal programming projects. For an example ofÂ a team programming project I participated in, please click <a href="http://msmurphy2.wix.com/cs534seamcarving" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
		<p>We were assigned to explore a specific area of computational photography. My group chose to implement and extend the seam carving algorithm so that it could be applied to video.</p>
		<p>Another example of a team project I participated in was for a college business class called Organizational Behavior. As a team, we studied the organizational and teamwork strategy of a real world organization and developed
recommendations for addressing issues in order to enhance the effectiveness of the organization.</div>
